This is the installation file for the GlassPlayerHost package.

RHEL 7 Embedded
./configure --prefix=/usr --libexecdir=/usr/bin --localstatedir=/usr/share/glassplayerhost

MANDATORY PREREQUISITES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need the following installed and configured properly on your 
system before building GlassCoder:

Qt4 Toolkit, v4.6 or better (http://www.qt.io/).

WebHost Library
Library and application framework for embedded systems.  Available at
http://github.com/ElvishArtsan/webhost


DOCUMENTATION
-------------
The GlassPlayerHost man pages are written in XML-DocBook5.  Pre-generated troff
versions are included in the source tarball, so special tools will not
normally be required to install them.  However, if you need to rebuild them
(either because you've modified the DocBook sources or are installing from
the primary GitHub repository), then you will need the following:

XML-DocBook5 Stylesheets.  Available at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/.  You will also need to create a
$DOCBOOK_STYLESHEETS variable in you environment that points to the top
of the stylesheet tree.  More information can be found at
http://www.docbook.org/tdg5/en/html/appa.html#s.stylesheetinstall.

xsltproc.  Command line XSLT processor.  Available at
http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html


BUILD ENVIRONMENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some distros may require that the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS
environmental variables be set prior to running 'configure' in order for
Qt4 to be detected properly.  Some known cases are:

  CentOS/RedHat 5 (i386): export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/lib/qt4/include
                	  export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib/qt4/lib
                	  export PATH=/usr/lib/qt4/bin:$PATH

CentOS/RedHat 5 (x86_64): export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/lib64/qt4/include
                 	  export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib64/qt4/lib64
                	  export PATH=/usr/lib64/qt4/bin:$PATH

Ubuntu:                   export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include/qt4


Configure script invocation:

INSTALLATION
------------
Once the prerequisites are set up, building and installation of the code is
done by cd'ing to the top of the source tree and typing './configure
[options]', 'make', followed (as root) by 'make install'.  Those who
obtained the source via CVS will need to do './autogen.sh' first.  There
are a number of options for the 'configure' script; do './configure --help'
for a detailed list.

BUILDING AN EMBEDDED ROOT FILESYSTEM

1) Install 'RedSleeve 7 Minimal'

2) Enable sound device by doing:
   echo snd-bcm2835 > /etc/modules-load.d/snd-bcm2835.conf

3) yum install ntp

4) Install Paravel platform ssh key in '/root/.ssh/authorized_keys'.

5) Edit '/etc/ssh/sshd_config' and change 'PasswordAuthentication yes'
   to 'PasswordAuthentiation no'.

6) systemctl stop chronyd
   systemctl disable chronyd
   systemctl start ntpd
   systemctl enable ntpd
